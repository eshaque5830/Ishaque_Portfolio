# [Project 2: Project Heart Disease Prediction UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ishaquealidad/heart-disease-prediction-uci-ipynb)

* Importing Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data handling, visualization, preprocessing, machine learning, and ignoring warnings
* Loading Data: Load the dataset from a CSV file.
* Data Exploration and Visualization: Visualize 'age' distribution, explore gender-based distribution, unique values in 'dataset', age distribution colored by dataset, and statistics of age grouped by dataset
* Missing Values Imputation: Handle missing values using RandomForestClassifier for categorical and RandomForestRegressor for continuous columns
* Outliers Handling: Create box plots and remove outliers in the 'trestbps' column
* Machine Learning Model: Split data, encode features, define models, iterate over models for cross-validation, evaluate, and save the best model with pickle
* The minimum age to have a heart disease starts from 28 years old
* Most of the people get heart disease at the age of 53-54 years
* Most of the males and females get are with heart disease at the age of 54-55 years
* Male percentage in the data: 78.91%
* Female Percentage in the data: 21.09%
* Males are 274.23% more than females in the data

# [Project 3:PAKISTAN International Airlines - Sentiment Analysis using VADER](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ishaquealidad/sentiment-analysis-vader-ipynb/edit)
* VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a method that determines the sentiment of a piece of text, such as a sentence or paragraph. VADER is a pre-built, lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool designed for social media text
* Utilize BeautifulSoup for web scraping Skytrax data on British Airways
* Clean text by removing special characters and numericals
* Tokenize and perform POS tagging for word context preservation
* Remove stopwords and lemmatize words for root forms
* Implement VADER for sentiment analysis and classification
* Visualize sentiment analysis results using matplotlib

# [Project 4:Rice Diseases Classification TensorFlow](https://github.com/eshaque5830/Deeplearning_Projects/blob/main/rice_disease_classification.ipynb)
* code implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow for classifying rice diseases based on input images
* A sequential CNN model is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API with convolutional, max-pooling, flattening, dropout, and dense layers
* The model is trained on the training dataset with early stopping to prevent overfitting
* Model Used: Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow
* Observations:
* We have 10407, images in train data.
* We have 10 unique disease classes.
* We also have 10 variesites of RICE in this data.
* We have rice plant age ranging from 45 - 85 days.
* ADT45 is the most common variety inside the training data.
